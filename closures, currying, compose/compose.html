//Avoiding side effects: Anything that happens externally outside of a function. Good developers must avoid this. Example below:
var a = 1;
function b(){
    a = 2;
}

//Determinism(i.e Functional purity): No matter what the inputs are in a function, it will always return same value.
//This is a key concept in javascript that helps to reduce bugs and prevent random errors.
