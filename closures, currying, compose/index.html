//Closures: A function ran. The function executed. It's never going to run again.
//But it remembers that there are references to those variables.
//So the child scope always has an access to the parent scope. while parent does not have an access to the child scope.

//So basically the scope within the child function expression(second) has an access to the parent function exp (first)
//Therefore, when we run this on the console, the alert box displays Hi, that's the value of the parent scope variable greet 






// CURRYING
//Converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a functiont that takes one at a time.
